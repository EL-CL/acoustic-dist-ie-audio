The speech sounds of 300 core words in this repository are synthesized using the text-to-speech engine in Microsoft [Azure AI Speech Studio](https://speech.microsoft.com/), which encompasses 42 Indo-European languages. Each word is synthesized in both male and female voices, resulting in a total of 25,200 audio clips (300 words × 42 languages × 2 genders). All audio clips are in 16-bit, 16 kHz, mono WAV format, with leading and trailing silences trimmed.

See [`word_list.csv`](word_list.csv) for the vocabulary of 300 core words in each language.
